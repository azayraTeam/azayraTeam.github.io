        <h1>SimplyPrivate 3.6.11</h1>

        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>SimplyPrivate 3.6.11 is a highly anticipated update, packed with improvements that will make your browsing experience faster and smoother. After some issues with version 3.6.1, we focused on fixing everything and bringing a more beautiful and functional interface. Let's see what changed ü§©</p>
    
        <h2>What Changed?</h2>
        <p>This version is all about performance and stability. A lot of things were updated, fixed, and even removed to improve the overall performance. Here are the most notable changes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Updated JAF:</strong> Now SimplyPrivate runs faster with the latest version of JAF (JustAFrogScript). Everything will feel smoother!</li>
            <li><strong>New Window/Popup Effects:</strong> It's no longer just a plain window; now it has a cool background blur effect that makes everything look much nicer.</li>
            <li><strong>Fixed Visual Issues:</strong> Themes and colors were adjusted to make it easier on the eyes and to make the environment more comfortable.</li>
            <li><strong>Fixed "Unknown Errors":</strong> That annoying error that made the browser crash when something failed? That's gone now!</li>
            <li><strong>Removed Shortcuts:</strong> We know this was a handy feature, but we had to remove it for now due to compatibility issues. It will come back in a future update!</li>
            <li><strong>Re-added Intro Animation:</strong> Remember that intro from version 3.6.0? Well, it's back with a fresh blue accent to give everything a more refreshing feel.</li>
            <li><strong>Updated Plugin Explorer:</strong> The whole plugin explorer system got a redesign, looking cleaner and more organized. Some features might be unavailable depending on your operating system, but we're working on that.</li>
            <li><strong>Updated Settings Command System:</strong> Instead of an impractical window, we now have a dropdown menu with all available commands!</li>
            <li><strong>Added Window Flexibility:</strong> You now have the freedom to adjust your window width, and the design will adapt to fit your needs!</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Overall Stability:</strong> We removed some development tools and made other tweaks to ensure a faster and smoother experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Fixed Internet Manager Math:</strong> In older versions, the math for calculating G's based on internet speed was totally wrong. We've fixed it by switching from jaf(argm) to jaf(basic).</li>
            <li><strong>Updated Reset Speed:</strong> Now, "delete all data" is much faster without using the file queue.</li>
            <li><strong>Added New Theme "Quartz":</strong> A smooth pastel purple-themed design for both light and dark mode users.</li>
            <li><strong>Fixed Missing Tab Icons:</strong> We switched to an API used by Google, so rest assured, it doesn't track anything.</li>
            <li><strong>Removed Unused Assets:</strong> Goodbye to all the unused files that were just taking up space!</li>
            <li><strong>Updated "Enjoy" Screen:</strong> That old blinding screen is now replaced with a friendly, simple animation!</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>How Does It Compare to Previous Versions?</h2>
        <p>When we compare it to version 3.6.1, the difference is huge. In 3.6.1, the browser was full of bugs and slowdowns, but with 3.6.11, the performance is much more stable and faster. The visual improvements, like the background blur and the new color scheme, make everything look much more modern and comfortable.</p>
        <p>However, some features, like the shortcuts, have been removed for now. But that's just to ensure that the current version is as stable as possible.</p>
    
        <h2>What to Expect?</h2>
        <p>Version 3.6.11 isn‚Äôt just a bug-fix update; it brings a fresh new energy to SimplyPrivate. We focused on bug fixes and improving performance, but we‚Äôre just getting started. More new features will come in the future, like a brand new design, developer tools, extension system, including the features that were removed for now, like the shortcuts.</p>
    
        <h3>Here‚Äôs a quick summary of what changed:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Updated JAF:</strong> Faster browsing!</li>
            <li><strong>New Window Effects:</strong> Background blur for a better look.</li>
            <li><strong>Fixed Visual and Stability Issues:</strong> No more crashes and easier-to-read themes.</li>
            <li><strong>New "Quartz" Theme:</strong> A nice purple pastel theme for both light and dark mode users.</li>
            <li><strong>More Flexible Windows:</strong> Adjust your window width to fit your needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Better Plugins:</strong> Easier access and new features!</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>SimplyPrivate 3.6.11 is one of the most important updates so far, bringing improvements to stability, performance, and making the browser look better and feel more comfortable. It‚Äôs not the final version, but it‚Äôs a solid foundation for what‚Äôs to come. We‚Äôre ready for the future, and version 3.6.11 is just the beginning of an even more powerful SimplyPrivate!</p>
